          WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH CLOUD COMPUTING?

          Cloud computing is useful for many things. Quite a bit of peoples' daily lives revolves around it. Most people use cloud computing services for storage. The cloud is a useful tool for storing data. People like storing their info on the cloud because there are plenty of services that give you gigabytes of data you can use for free or little cost. This is especially useful for people who have little storage on their devices. With the cloud, you can also access your files from anywhere. Just upload the file to the cloud computing service of your choice, and then log in to your account from any computer with Internet service. You'll have access to your files from there.

          WHAT ARE SOME CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES?

      </h3>

          There are quite a few, actually. These services are mainly divided into two categories: personal or enterprise.
          <br>
          <br>
          On the personal side, you have services like Apple's iCloud, Google's Drive, or Microsoft's OneDrive. All support storage of files like documents, presentations, pictures, spreadsheets, and much more. Google Drive's cloud computing services also come with things like Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, Keep, Gmail, Translate, Photos, News, Maps, Search, Calendar, and more that can be accessed from virtually anywhere. iCloud comes with Keynote, Numbers, iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Photo Library, Mail, Calendar, Maps, News, Notes, Reminders, iMessage, Health, Wallet, Contacts, iTunes, and more. iCloud's services are easier to work with and access on Apple devices (iOS, macOS, etc.), but most services can be accessed via the web or apps. OneDrive works well with Microsoft's Office 365 program and helps store files made in Office applications such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Publisher, etc., but Office 365 is a seperate purchase and is not included with OneDrive. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Then there's the enterprise/business side of things. You'll find services like Google G Suite, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, IBM Cloud, and more here. These services do some remote computing for their clients as well as storing files the same as personal cloud services. Some of these services offer cool things, such as G Suite offering your own email domain with any purchase.
